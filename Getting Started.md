# Getting Started

It's recommended that you start by downloading the Anaconda Python Distribution 
(we will use Python 2 syntax for this class, but the conversion to Python 3 is simple) from
[Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io); it's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux,
and comes with all the packages you'll need for this class pre-installed.

Windows users may want to consider setting up VirtualBox with Ubuntu Linux.
While this is not necessary for this class, scientific computing is 
significantly complicated by using a Windows machine, and you'll need to use
a workaround to get the _git_ tool used for version control.

Once you have Python, go ahead and download the PyCharm IDE; it has a lot of features and is much 
simpler to use than a text editor. You should be able to get free access to the
Professional edition with your .edu email; if you don't have one, the Community edition
is also sufficient.

Once you have PyCharm installed, you'll want to go into Preferences 
and make sure that the anaconda python is set 
as the project interpreter for this project. Type "interpreter" into the search
box and the project interpreter option should show up.
I also recomend setting the theme to "Darcula," which is a bit easier 
on the eyes than the standard white theme.

Finally, you'll want to set up git on your machine. If you have a Mac,
type "git" at the command line, and you'll download some XCode Developer
Tools that will set up git automatically; if you have a Windows machine,
I recommend setting up an Atlassian account and using their free
SourceTree software to set up git on your machine.

Once you have all of that, you can use the git clone command either from the
Terminal (on Mac or Linux) or from the git terminal provided by SourceTree
to download the course materials.
