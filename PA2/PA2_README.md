# Programming Assignment 2


## Getting Started
You should be able to integrate your code from last week
## Instructions
You will have to start thinking about insertions and deletions now, but your first job is still to write code that does a good job of identifying SNPs.  The most important thing you'll have to worry about on this assignment is speed; your code can end up going too slowly if you don't implement some optimizations.
## Outline of provided scripts
The hasher only changes the speed at which you're going to get aligned reads, but it's also going to provide a bit more complicated output that you'll have to disentangle to 
## What You Should Change
Play with the basic hasher. Think about what it does well and does poorly. Try it out on the larger datasets.

What's a good choice for the key length here?
